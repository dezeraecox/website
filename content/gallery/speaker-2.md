Avindra (Avi) Nath is the Clinical Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at NIH, where he is also Chief of the Section of Infections of the Nervous System, Director of the Translational Center for Neurological Sciences. He started his research career studying the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection and has applied those principles to study the neuropathogenesis of endogenous retroviruses. His laboratory discovered the expression of HML-2 in ALS and glioblastoma which is now a major focus of research in his lab. His laboratory has also studied the neuropathogenesis of emerging infections such as Ebola, Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 and conducts research on patients with undiagnosed neuroinflammatory disorders. The common underlying theme is to study mechanisms of viral persistence in the brain and develop novel therapeutic approaches. He is the past President and the recipient of the Pioneer award from the International Society of NeuroVirology and received an award for scientific achievements by the World Federation of Neurology. He is an elected member of the Association of American Physicians, the National Academy of Medicine, a fellow of AAAS and a previous Board member of the American Neurological Association. In 2024, TIME magazine named him amongst the 100 most influential people in health. 

## Abstract

### Endogenous Retroviruses in Pathophysiology and as Therapeutic Targets in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Several retroviruses have been implicated in the pathophysiology of motor neuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like syndromes. This includes murine leukemia virus, HIV and HTLV-1. We and others have found that several loci within the human chromosome for an endogenous retrovirus, HML-2, get activated and cause toxicity of motor neurons resulting in the phenotype of ALS. These viruses highly mutated but can form immature viral particles. They are critical in early embryonic development but are silenced in the healthy adult brain. The toxicity is mediated by the envelope protein of the virus via a multitude of mechanisms. This includes aggregation of TDP-43, translocation of the signal peptide to the nucleolus, interactions with CD98HC on neurons which is also the receptor of the virus and dysregulation of immune responses to the virus. Other proteins encoded by the virus are also expressed in ALS, however, their role in the pathophysiology of the disease is not fully understood. None the less, the expression of these proteins provides several new therapeutic targets. This includes development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies to neutralize the envelope protein, shRNA to decrease its expression, and new compounds that would target the reverse transcriptase, protease, integrase or capsid of the virus. Pilot studies have been conducted using combination antiretroviral drugs in ALS. They have identified a subgroup of individuals in whom the viral load decreases with treatment and rebounds following withdrawal of the drugs. The clinical relevance of these observations needs to be confirmed in larger studies.
