Dr Natasha Speight (BSc BVMS PhD) is a senior lecturer at the School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, University of Adelaide. Natasha has led koala health and disease research in South Australia for over 15 years, with broad interests in both infectious and non-infectious diseases. Recent topics of research have included Chlamydia infection, kidney disease, thyroid disease, blood reference intervals, and bushfire injury outcomes. Natasha has supervised two PhD student projects focussed on koala retrovirus, with the overarching aims of determining prevalence and pathology of infection, including cancers, in South Australian koalas. This research has led to 10 journal publications on koala retrovirus, several as part of collaborative projects. Natasha continues to be interested in the transmission and pathogenesis of koala retrovirus, and how this can be applied to the conservation and management of populations.

## Abstract

Following an expansion of research on endogenous koala retrovirus (KoRV) in northern Australian koalas, our research aimed to investigate KoRV infection of southern koalas, particularly prevalence, associated pathology, and molecular characteristics. We sampled a total of 245 wild koalas from two large and geographically distinct South Australian populations to determine KoRV prevalence, and examined 92 koalas at postmortem examination for pathology and histopathology associated with infection. Following this, samples from 216 koalas were used for characterisation of the KoRV provirus genes, and subsequently the KoRV expression profile, to improve molecular diagnosis and better understand transmission dynamics. We determined a prevalence of 42% of KoRV in the Kangaroo Island koala population, and 65% in the Mount Lofty Ranges population. KoRV-A and not KoRV-B were detected, and proviral loads were low. Of the 92 post-mortem cases, four koalas were found to have lymphoma, and these had high proviral loads. All proviral genes (gag1, gag2, pol, env1, env 2) were found to be present in 89/216 koalas (41%), however the KoRV expression profile in the central region (gag2, pol, env1) for three of these positive koalas was fragmented compared to two positive koalas with lymphoma. Koalas that were negative for central KoRV proviral genes showed expression of gag 1 and terminal regions. The lower prevalence of KoRV, lower proviral loads in positive koalas, and incomplete expression profile unless lymphomic, point to predominantly exogenous transmission of KoRV in southern koalas, but the presence of retroviral gene segments in KoRV-negative koalas suggests an endogenisation event.
