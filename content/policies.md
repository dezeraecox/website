## Diversity, Balance and Inclusion Statement

The AussiERV Symposium Committee recognises that some sections of the scientific community are often under-represented in conference programs and attendance, which can adversely affect the community’s long-term diversity goals. Our policies are developed to promote equality in all aspects of the Symposium.

The program chairs will ensure that the scientific program is of the highest quality and encompasses speakers representing the broad diversity of our community, without bias regarding gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, geography, (dis)abilities, or nation of origin. We also commit to pursuing gender parity with respect to invited speakers and session chairs.

We are proud that the organising committee is composed of early- and mid-career researchers from different Australian research ecosystems, and welcome applications from the community to join this organising committee. We will report statistics on the geographic distribution, career stage, and gender balance of speakers, session chairs, and attendees following the Symposium.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, or religion. All Symposium participants—including attendees, speakers, volunteers, exhibitors, staff, and service providers—are expected to abide by the following Code of Conduct.

### Expected Behaviour

By participating in the Symposium, you agree to:

- Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative with others.
- Communicate openly, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.
- Value and encourage a diversity of views and opinions.
- Avoid personal attacks or insults directed toward other participants.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and fellow participants, reporting any issues immediately.
- Respect the rules and policies of the meeting venue.
- Adhere to the Social Media Guidelines and any health and safety policies.

### Unacceptable Behaviour

Physical or verbal abuse, harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
- Inappropriate physical or virtual contact, sexual attention, or innuendo.
- Deliberate intimidation or stalking.
- Photography or recording of an individual without consent.
- Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

Recording or photography of another individual's presentation without explicit consent is not permitted. Please refer to the Social Media Guidelines for more information.

## Social Media Guidelines

We encourage you to engage with social media before, during, and after the Symposium to share information and build networks. Please be mindful of the following guidelines:

- Attendees are welcome to blog, post, or tweet about the Symposium, unless a speaker explicitly requests otherwise. Speakers may request that specific details or slides are not shared using a "Please don't share" logo.
- The use of photographic, video, or other recording devices is strictly prohibited in sessions displaying the "Please don't share" logo. Do not post photos or recordings from these sessions to any online platform.
- Do not capture, transmit, or re-distribute data presented by others at the Symposium. Respect journal embargo policies and do not jeopardise the work of your colleagues.
- All online communication should be respectful and considerate. Criticism should be directed at ideas, not individuals.
- Remember to tag the Symposium on social media and use the official event hashtag.

## Reporting Procedure

If you are the subject of unacceptable behaviour or have witnessed any such behaviour, please notify a committee member on-site or anonymously via our contact form. All reports will be handled confidentially.

Anyone experiencing or witnessing behaviour that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to public safety should contact triple-zero (000) and/or venue security.

Anyone requested to cease unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. Security may take any action deemed necessary, including immediate removal from the Symposium without warning or refund. The committee reserves the right to prohibit attendance at future meetings by anyone violating this code of conduct.
